## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## My Daily Planner
 
```
On page load, my daily planner lists the date and time, which refreshes every second
It displays the hours 9 through 6 (a more accurate work day) and allows the user
to input text for each hour and save into local storage
Once the page reloads, it gets any information that was previously saved and displays it on the screen
